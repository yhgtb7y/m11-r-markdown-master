# Store a variable "movie"

# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  
  # Replace all of the spaces in your movie title with plus signs (+)
  
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  
  
  
  # Request data using your search query
  
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  
  
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  
}

# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
